# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
A credit card fraud detection model developed using scikit-learn, pandas, powered by the XGBoost algorithm.

This project aims to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions based on patterns and anomalies in the data. It is designed to help financial institutions identify and prevent fraudulent transactions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. These transactions occurred over a span of two days, and out of 284,807 transactions, 492 were fraudulent.

### Imbalance in the Dataset
The dataset is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for only 0.172% of all transactions. This imbalance presents a unique challenge and will require careful consideration during the model development process.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing the number of false positives. This will involve exploring various machine learning and data sampling techniques to handle the imbalanced dataset.
